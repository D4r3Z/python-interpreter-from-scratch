# **INTERPRETER ON PYTHON FROM SCRATCH**
It is a half-baked interpreter that I made from scratch on python. Perhaps this will help someone understand the basics of interpreter development or something like that. I got inspiration for the development from the well-known book with a dragon and several channels on YouTube (special thanks to CodePulse)
## **How to run it?**
Just go to *shell.py*, change file dir on *12th line* and run it!
## **What can this interpreter do?**
Init variables, calculation, *WHILE* cycle, *IF/ELSE* branching, call *build-in functions*, multiline comments.
## **What's syntax of this?**
You can check towers.txt file to see syntax of language.
