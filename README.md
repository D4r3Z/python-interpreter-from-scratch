# python-interpreter-from-scratch
It is a half-baked interpreter that I made from scratch on python. Perhaps this will help someone understand the basics of interpreter development or something like that. I got inspiration for the development from the well-known book with a dragon and several channels on YouTube (special thanks to CodePulse)
